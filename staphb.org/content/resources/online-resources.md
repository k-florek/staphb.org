The public health bioinformatics community is continuosly producing new training content for laboratorians and epidemiologists. Much of this focuses on new technology and its applications. But there is already a wealth of information and training content available if one knows where to look. This section hopes to serve as a resource where currently available material is identified and links provided to that content.

### New York Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence

The NY Integrated Food Safety CoE has extensive online materials for molecular epidemiology targeting both the laboratorian and epidemiologist. The site can be found [HERE](https://nyfoodsafety.cals.cornell.edu/molecular-epidemiology/) and contains training [Modules](https://nyfoodsafety.cals.cornell.edu/molecular-epidemiology/modules/), [Webinars](https://nyfoodsafety.cals.cornell.edu/molecular-epidemiology/webinars/), a [Q&A](https://nyfoodsafety.cals.cornell.edu/molecula) section, and [Additional Resources](https://nyfoodsafety.cals.cornell.edu/molecular-epidemiology/additional-resources/).

### Colorado Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence

The CO Integrated Food Safety CoE has training materials for both epidemiologists and laboratorians on the applications of WGS for outbreak analysis. The site can be found [HERE](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/foodsafety/Pages/default.aspx) which includes a [Training](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/foodsafety/Pages/Training.aspx) section and a recorded [Seminars](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/foodsafety/Pages/Seminars.aspx) section. The materials geared more towards epidemiology and some examples of where WGS can assist in an investigation.
