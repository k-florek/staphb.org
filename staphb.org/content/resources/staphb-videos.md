Every month the StaPH-B community gets together for an online presentation. These presenations are recorded and presented here for your review.

#### April 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 3: Local Nextstrain
As a follow up to our last call, during which Alli Black from the Bedford laboratory spoke about the NextStrain platform and its applications in COVID-19 response efforts, we invited Heather Blankenship--a bioinformatics scientist at the Michigan public health laboratory--to speak about her experience setting up a local NextStrain build for real-time COVID-19 surveillance in Michigan.

Heather discussed the advantages of local NextStrain builds for state laboratories and outlined the steps she has taken to set things up in her environment. Following this, we opened the floor for a Q&A session with Heather.

#### April 2020 - COVID-19 Special Epside 2: NextStrain
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilized our scheduled call to host a discussion regarding the various COVID-19 sequencing and analysis protocols available to the public health laboratories. A specific focus on the ARTIC Network's protocols for COVID-19 sequencing and genome assembly, as these seem the most appropriate for US state laboratories. Here are the [slides](https://storage.googleapis.com/staphb-resources/staphb-org-files/staphb-videos-page/alliblack-staphb-04-03-2020.pdf) for this presentation.

#### March 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 1: SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilized our scheduled call to host a discussion regarding the various COVID-19 sequencing and analysis protocols available to the public health laboratories. A specific focus on the ARTIC Network's protocols for COVID-19 sequencing and genome assembly, as these seem the most appropriate for US state laboratories.

##### February 2020 - Cromwell Workflow Manager
Danny Park, group lead of the viral computational genomics at the Broad Institute and technical consultant for the North East Bioinformatics Regional Resource, spoke about scientific compute workflow management.

##### January 2020 - StaPH-B Toolkit
In this month's call, Kelsey Florek and Kevin Libuit presented on the StaPH-B ToolKit. The StaPH-B ToolKit is a Python library written to relieve the burden of major bioinformatics challenges Kelsey and Kevin have identified throughout our respective regions: access to and proper use of StaPH-B docker images, capture of data lineage information, configurable and distributable pipeline parameters, and the portability of StaPH-B developed workflows. This call provided a brief overview of the StaPH-B ToolKit, its design concept, and its utility for public health laboratories. Following presentation,  a live-demo of the StaPH-B ToolKit was presented to demonstrate the simple installation requirements and its major functionalities using a sample dataset.

##### December 2019 - Madrone by Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub
For our December 2019 call, we have invited Lucy Li and David Dynerman from the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub to speak about Madrone, a user-friendly bioinformatics platform for cluster analysis and AMR gene detection for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Madrone was developed in collaboration between the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub and the Alameda County (CA) Public Health Laboratory to address Alameda's bioinformatics needs. Since its development, Madrone has been made available to a number of public health and healthcare facilities across the US. David and Lucy are leading the Madrone pilot program and are currently seeking other collaborators interested in accessing their platform.

##### November 2019 - NGS Validations
For our November's call, we've invited Nick Matluk, the Microbiology and CLIA Technical Supervisor at the Maine state laboratory. Nick provided background on Maine's use of WGS to support infectious disease investigations and detailed their approach to CLIA validation of bioinformatics workflows on Qiagen's CLC Genomics Workbench platform.

##### October 2019 - Singularity Container System
For this month's call, we had a second discussion on container platforms: Jake Garfin (Minnesota Department of Health) and Curtis Kapsak (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) presented an overview of the Singularity container system, it's similarities and differences compared to Docker, and a short usage demonstration. This is particularly helpful for laboratories that are interested in using the StaPH-B Docker Images, but lack root privileges required to run Docker in their compute environments.

##### July 2019 - Scott Becker, Executive Director of APHL
Scott Becker, Executive Director of APHL spoke about the field of bioinformatics, its current impact on public health, and where things may be going in the years to come. Scott also offered his advice on keeping a workgroup like StaPH-B a cohesive and effective resource for public health.

##### May 2019 - Genetic Determinants of AMR
In this webinar, Jessica Chen from the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) to discuss her laboratory's strategy to developing a robust bioinformatics pipeline for rapid detection of AMR determinants from WGS data.
