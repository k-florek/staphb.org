Every month the StaPH-B community gets together for an online presentation. These presenation are recoreded and presented here for your review.

##### StaPH-B Monthly Call - December 2019
For our December 2019 call, we have invited Lucy Li and David Dynerman from the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub to speak about Madrone, a user-friendly bioinformatics platform for cluster analysis and AMR gene detection for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Madrone was developed in collaboration between the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub and the Alameda County (CA) Public Health Laboratory to address Alameda's bioinformatics needs. Since its development, Madrone has been made available to a number of public health and healthcare facilities across the US. David and Lucy are leading the Madrone pilot program and are currently seeking other collaborators interested in accessing their platform.

##### StaPH-B Monthly Call - November 2019
For our November's call, we've invited Nick Matluk, the Microbiology and CLIA Technical Supervisor at the Maine state laboratory. Nick provided background on Maine's use of WGS to support infectious disease investigations and detailed their approach to CLIA validation of bioinformatics workflows on Qiagen's CLC Genomics Workbench platform.

##### StaPH-B Monthly Call - October 2019
For this month's call, we had a second discussion on container platforms: Jake Garfin (Minnesota Department of Health) and Curtis Kapsak (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) presented an overview of the Singularity container system, it's similarities and differences compared to Docker, and a short usage demonstration. This is particularly helpful for laboratories that are interested in using the StaPH-B Docker Images, but lack root privileges required to run Docker in their compute environments.

##### StaPH-B Monthly Call - July 2019
Scott Becker, Executive Director of APHL spoke about the field of bioinformatics, its current impact on public health, and where things may be going in the years to come.Scott also offered his advice on keeping a workgroup like StaPH-B a cohesive and effective resource for public health.

##### StaPH-B Monthly Call - May 2019
In this webinar, Jessica Chen from the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) to discuss her laboratory's strategy to developing a robust bioinformatics pipeline for rapid detection of AMR determinants from WGS data.
