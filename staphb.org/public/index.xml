      <description>Every month the StaPH-B community gets together for an online presentation. These presenations are recoreded and presented here for your review.
StaPH-B Monthly Call - January 2020 In this month&#39;s call, Kelsey Florek and Kevin Libuit presented on the StaPH-B ToolKit. The StaPH-B ToolKit is a Python library written to relieve the burden of major bioinformatics challenges Kelsey and Kevin have identified throughout our respective regions: access to and proper use of StaPH-B docker images, capture of data lineage information, configurable and distributable pipeline parameters, and the portability of StaPH-B developed workflows.</description>

      <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;demystifying-webinar-series--january-2020--microbial-species-identification&#34;&gt;Demystifying Webinar Series | January 2020 | Microbial Species Identification&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our January 2020 webinar, we discuss how bacterial species identification is conducted using NGS data. Topics focus on both average nucleotide identify (ANI) and Mash, how they are similar, how they are different, and when it is appropriate to use one versus the other.

      <title>Online Resources for Molecular and Genomic Epidemiology</title>

      <description>The public health bioinformatics community is continuosly producing new training content for laboratorians and epidemiologists. Much of this focuses on new technology and its applications. But there is already a wealth of information and training content available if one knows where to look. This section hopes to serve as a resource where currently available material is identified and links provided to that content.
New York Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence The NY Integrated Food Safety CoE has extensive online materials for molecular epidemiology targeting both the laboratorian and epidemiologist.</description>

      <description>This glossary is adapted from Kelsey Florek and her Midwest Region AMD Pages on GitHub. The glossary is reproduced here for the benefit of those who cannot access GitHub.
Bioinformatics This discipline is involved in the collection, analysis, and storage of complex biological data, including, but not limited to genetic data. The field combines computer science, statistics, and several aspects of biology to be able to understand highly complex data.</description>

      <description>In the beginning&amp;hellip; Who are we? How did this all begin? Well, at first there were four: Kevin Libuit, Sean Wang, Kelly Oakeson, and Joel Sevinsky. And by four we mean there were at least four of us bothering Heather Carleton for help with bioinformatics of enteric pathogens around winter 2016/2017. Heather suggested, probably to save herself from answering too many questions and often the same question four times, that the group of should &amp;ldquo;talk amongst ourselves&amp;rdquo;, and our contact information was shared.</description>

      <description>It has been a long time coming, but we have decided to support a website where we can aggregate all the training and information in genomic epidemiology in one location, as well as provide new and inique content for public health bioinformatics.</description>
