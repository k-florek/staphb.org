      <description>Every month the StaPH-B community gets together for an online presentation. These presenations are recoreded and presented here for your review.
StaPH-B Monthly Call - January 2020 In this month&#39;s call, Kelsey Florek and Kevin Libuit presented on the StaPH-B ToolKit. The StaPH-B ToolKit is a Python library written to relieve the burden of major bioinformatics challenges Kelsey and Kevin have identified throughout our respective regions: access to and proper use of StaPH-B docker images, capture of data lineage information, configurable and distributable pipeline parameters, and the portability of StaPH-B developed workflows.</description>

      <description>The public health bioinformatics community is continuosly producing new training content for laboratorians and epidemiologists. Much of this focuses on new technology and its applications. But there is already a wealth of information and training content available if one knows where to look. This section hopes to serve as a resource where currently available material is identified and links provided to that content.
New York Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence The NY Integrated Food Safety CoE has extensive online materials for molecular epidemiology targeting both the laboratorian and epidemiologist.</description>
