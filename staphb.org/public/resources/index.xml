      <description>Amazon Web Services Batch is a service that allows users to submit jobs to job queues while specifying the application to be run and compute resources that are needed by the job. Working in concert with Nextflow, AWS Batch can be configured to run Nextflow processes in defined compute environments minimizing the cost of cloud resources.
Useful Resources This tutorial was written using Alex Peltzer&amp;rsquo;s guide and Anthony Underwood&amp;rsquo;s guide as resources.</description>

      <description>The public health bioinformatics community is continuosly producing new training content for laboratorians and epidemiologists. Much of this focuses on new technology and its applications. But there is already a wealth of information and training content available if one knows where to look. This section hopes to serve as a resource where currently available material is identified and links provided to that content.
New York Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence The NY Integrated Food Safety CoE has extensive online materials for molecular epidemiology targeting both the laboratorian and epidemiologist.</description>
